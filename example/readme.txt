# Order programming examples

An attempt has been made to make each example mostly self-contained
at the cost of repeating some explanations. A reader having a good
understanding of programming should be able to follow the examples
with a minimal understanding of the Order language. The narrative
body of each example briefly motivates the example and gives a bit
of background information, but doesn't aim to explain every detail
of each Order language feature used.

Most of the examples are meant to apply programming techniques that
are likely to be useful in practice to the kind of problems that one
might encounter in practice, but none of the examples is meant to be
an industry strength solution. This is emphasized by exercises,
given at the end of each example, that ask the reader to modify and
extend the examples in various ways. While it is probably too much
to ask the reader to complete all the exercises, all readers are
strongly recommended to preprocess one or more examples to actually
see what is ultimately being generated.
